Gemini is a backend REST framework to automatically create CRUD REST APIs from scratch (with no coding),  starting from
a simple Schema definition called Gemini DSL. Briefly Gemini automatically handles for you:
* **Persistence**: creating all the storage and entity managers
* **API controllers**: creating all the common REST methods
* **Swagger API documentation**: creating the openapi language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs 
* **Authentication**: by using OAuth2 // WIP work in progress
* **API callbacks**: to add business logic with ease // WIP work in progress

    * Support for simple data types (TEXT, NUMBERS, DATES, TIME ...)
    * Support for custom and complex types (FILE, IMAGE, ...) // WIP work in progress
* **Automagical generation** of REST CRUD APIs for each Resource
    * POST - PUT - GET - DELETE are available out of the box
    * Support for custom routes (Gemini Services available)

For example lets use the Gemini DSL to define....

```text
# ..two simple Entities: Book and Author. Where * is used to specify the logical key

ENTITY Book {
      TEXT        isbn    *
      TEXT        name
      AUTHOR      author
      DECIMAL     price
}
  
ENTITY Author {
      TEXT    name        *
      DATE    birthdate
}

# The followinf routes are automatically available  
# /api/book             GET (list) / POST (single resouce)
# /api/book/{isbn}      GET / PUT / DELETE (single resource)

# /api/author           GET (list) / POST (single resouce)
# /api/author/{isbn}    GET / PUT / DELETE (single resource)

# Where Book has a reference to Author by using its name (logical key)
```

**ATTENTION:** Gemini is a WIP and it is not ready for production environments.

## Quick start
Gemini was developed to be used with different storage drivers. Currently it supports postgresql database storage. 

##### Requirements
* Postgresql 11
* Java 9+
* Gradle 5+

##### Build Executable
Gemini is built on SpringBoot that allow to generate a standalone executable file with all dependencies.
```bash
# from gemini root - to build a standalone jar
gradle bootJar

# from gemini root - to build a standalone EXECUTABLE jar
gradle executableJar
cd gemini-postgresql/dist
```
Before executing the standalone/executable jar remember that SpringBoot need some properties to run. Let's use the
`application.properties` to define the Gemini Postgresql datasource with and for example the server port.

This is a simple config to fully startup Gemini (from Spring)

```
# application.properties
spring.datasource.url= jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/gem
spring.datasource.username=gem
spring.datasource.password=gem
server.port = 8090
```
 
Now you can run the jar. 
```
# for standalone (bootJar) you need to use java -jar 
./java -jar gemini-postgresql-0.1-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

# while for executable (executableJar) you can run it
# works on linux based machines - only some platform supported - take a look at Spring documentation
./gemini-postgresql-0.1-SNAPSHOT-executable.jar
```

Gemini automatically setup its internal structures and creates the ```schema/Runtime.at``` abstract type file in the
working directory. Now you can customize this file with all your entities, by using the Gemini DSL.
Then restart the application to see your APIs in action.

If you want to easily navigate APIs you can use the Swagger openapi tools. Gemini automatically generate the openapi 3
json file `api/openapi.json`


## DSL and APIs

### Entity and Logical Keys

Entities are the most important element of Gemini. They defines:
* REST Resources routes (via the EntityName)
    * `/api/{entityName}` is the default route
    * `GET api/{entityName}` for the list of available resources
    * `POST api/{entityName}` to insert a new one
* Body Fields (and their type)
    * JSON is the out of the BOX supported content type
* Entity Resource Record logical key (with `*`)
    * `/api/{entityName}/{resourseLogicalKey}` is the target route for a single resource
    * `GET /api/{entityName}/{resourseLogicalKey}` to get the single resource
    * `PUT /api/{entityName}/{resourseLogicalKey}` to update/modify the single resource

```
# For example this is a valid Entity

ENTITY SimpleText {
    TEXT   code *
}

# lets insert a resource
$ curl -d '{"code":"thelk"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/simpletext -i

  HTTP/1.1 200
  Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
  
  {"code":"thelk"}
 
# now we can query the previous inserted one
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/simpletext/thelk -i
  
  HTTP/1.1 200
  Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

  {"code":"thelk"}
```

### Primitive Types

Primitive types are numbers, strings and booleans and their aliases.

```
ENTITY PrimitiveTypes {
    TEXT            code *          // TEXT is the single type for Strings  
    DOUBLE          double
    DECIMAL         anotherDouble
    NUMBER          anyNumber       // (any number, no matter if it is a floating point or not)
    LONG            long
    QUANTITY        anotherLong
    BOOL            isOk
}
```

#### Numbers
In Json notation *Number* is a single type. In Gemini it is the same, but it adds some semantic to each field (useful
for validation)

* **DOUBLE** or **DECIMAL**: floating point numbers
* **LONG** or **QUANTITY**: integer numbers
* **NUMBER**: any number no matter if it has decimals or not 

*they may be extended (for example adding only naturals numbers and so on)*

#### Strings and Text
Any string field can be defined with the **TEXT** type. No matter its size, it is a JSON string.

#### Boolean
Boolean is *true* or *false* and can be defined with the **BOOL** type

#### API example

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/primitivetypes -i
  -d '{"code":"logicalKey","anotherDouble":7.77,"double":7.77,"isOk":true,"anotherLong":7,"anyNumber":70,"long":7}'
  
   HTTP/1.1 200
   Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
   
   {"code":"logicalKey","anotherDouble":7.77,"double":7.77,"isOk":true,"anotherLong":7,"anyNumber":70,"long":7}
```


### Date And Time
Dates and Times are Strings (in JSON notation). Gemini uses the ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats standard. 

```
ENTITY DatesEntity {
    TEXT        code *
    DATE        aDate
    TIME        aTime
    DATETIME    aDateTime
}
```

#### Date
**DATE** is the type you can use for a simple local date (no need of timezone).
Out of the box supported JSON API format is `yyyy-MM-dd`.

#### Time
**TIME** is the type you can use for ISO-8601 standard time. ISO-TIME is the out of the box supported format.
So for example the JSON String `09:41:43.973Z` is a valid time.

#### Datetime
**DATETIME** can be used for a date time field. It is a full ISO-8601 standard ISO-DATE-TIME.
So for example `2019-05-19T09:41:30.000Z` is a valid value.

#### API example

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/datestypes -i -d '{"aTime":"11:11:05.759Z","code":"lkdate","aDate":"2019-05-19","aDateTime":"2019-05-19T11:09:58Z"}'
    
    HTTP/1.1 200
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

    {"aTime":"11:11:05.759Z","code":"lkdate","aDate":"2019-05-19","aDateTime":"2019-05-19T11:09:58Z"}
```

### Entity Reference Types

Each defined Entity (with a logical key) is itself a Gemini Type. 

```
ENTITY Tag {
    TEXT    name    *
    TEXT    description
}

# Tag is a type that we can use in the Post Entity

ENTITY Post {
    LONG postId *
    TEXT message
    Tag  tag
}
```

#### API Example - Insert Tag and Post

First of all we need at least one tag.
```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/tag -i -d '{"name":"italy","description":"We ❤️ Italy"}'

    HTTP/1.1 200
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

    {"name":"italy","description":"We ❤️ Italy"}
```

To insert the POST only the logical key of Tag is required. 

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/post -i -d '{"postid":1,"message":"Rome", "tag": "italy"}'

    HTTP/1.1 200
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

    {"tag":"italy","postId":1,"message":"Rome"}
```

#### API Example - Post with unknown Tag

What if we try to insert a Post with an unknown tag?. Not found error!!!

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/post -i -d '{"postid":2,"message":"Rome", "tag": "unknown"}'

    HTTP/1.1 404
```

### Arrays

Arrays are a Work in Progress. Gemini will supports array out of the box either from primitive types or complex types. 
Actually is supported only the TEXT array.

```
ENTITY Messages {
    LONG messageId *
    [TEXT] message
}
```

## Gemini CORE Module
Core is the main module of Gemini and it defines some features, and predefined entities (and fields) available also
for developers. Take a look at the `Core.at` abstract type schema.

### ENTITY and FIELD


Gemini tracks all the Entities using the ENTITY Entity. All fields instead are stored in the FIELD Entity. 
It looks like a work game, but let's query them.

```
# The list of all available entities
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/entity -i

# The list of all available fields
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/field -i
```

By convention, entity names are always expressed (and stored) in UPPERCASE notation. While fields are handled in
LOWERCASE notation. 

### Gemini META data
Gemini handle meta data for each operation performed on a single EntityRecord. You can retrieve these meta information
using the Gemini header.

```
Gemini: gemini.api

The JSON response has the following schema
{
    "meta": {...}
    "data": {...}
}
```

NB: Core metadata are defined inside the `Core.at` schema and by default information about created and modified time
are automatically stored by the framework.


Let's query for example the `PrimitiveTypes` defines earlier.

```
$ curl -H "Gemini: gemini.api" http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/primitivetypes/test -i
    HTTP/1.1 200
    Gemini: gemini.api
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

    {
        "data":{"code":"test","anotherDouble":0.01,"double":0.2,"isOk":true,"anotherLong":2,"anyNumber":0.01,"long":1},
        "meta":{
            "created":"2019-05-19T14:49:57.765151Z",
            "modified":"2019-05-19T14:49:57.765151Z",
            "uuid":"97907b5d-854a-34ff-92ef-251055adba2a"
         }
     }
```

#### UUID-V3

Gemini automatically create a unique ID for each record by using UUID-v3 ids generated starting from the logical key.

You can query resources also by their UUID, especially when the logical key is made by multiple fields.

```
# note that there are not meta because we have not inserted the Gemini header in the request
# The uuid the same returned from the previuous example

$ curl  http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/primitivetypes/97907b5d-854a-34ff-92ef-251055adba2a -i

    HTTP/1.1 200
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

    {"code":"test","anotherDouble":0.01,"double":0.2,"isOk":true,"anotherLong":2,"anyNumber":0.01,"long":1}

```
